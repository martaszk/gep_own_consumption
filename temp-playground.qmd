This is Ryan's playground to see how code works. 


```{python}
# Dependencies
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
```


```{python}
df_iso3 = pd.read_csv('./input/ISO-3-codes.csv', delimiter=',', encoding='utf-8')
vars_keep = ["name","alpha-2","alpha-3", "region", "sub-region"]
df_iso3 = df_iso3[vars_keep]
# df_iso3.head()
```
