# TODO: Using the results, fill in the missing values for 
    # missing own consumption for country/year = point estimate (0.0193) * FAO value for a country/year

# Two countries with missing FAO commerical data: Uganda and Gutemala

# CHECK: Using formula to predict for own consumption values we have. What is the difference (e.g., what is the error)


# CHECK: What is the value per hectacre in each country? Do we have outliers?
