"""
Purpose: 
This script uses the panel data for own consumption (by year and country) to generate the GEP value for 
own consumption ecosystem service value. 
This outputs the panel of gep value which will be used by the larger GEP team.

# Import completed panel 
data-own-consumption-interpolation.csv
# Translate into monetary value aggregated at the nation by year level 
    # TODO: Something like number of farmers per year per country

# TODO: Upscale by the number of farms (or number of people) in each country...
    # Maybe static over time, but changing over time.
    
# Adjustment for nature's contribution (agricultural resource rent = land)

# export the gep value panel as csv
